Bit-banding is a feature that allows you to access and modify individual bits in memory or peripheral registers using special alias addresses

We use it because it-
Makes bit manipulation atomic (no need for read-modify-write)
Useful for flags, GPIO control, etc.

Certain memory regions (SRAM and peripheral) have alias regions
We can use those addresses to set or clear a specific bit
