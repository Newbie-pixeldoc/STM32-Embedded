So it uses serial wire viewer(swv) to print the message of whatever we want using printf
we added this file little code in syscall file
  //void ITM_SendChar(uint8_t ch)
{

	//Enable TRCENA
	DEMCR |= ( 1 << 24);

	//enable stimulus port 0
	ITM_TRACE_EN |= ( 1 << 0);

	// read FIFO status in bit [0]:
	while(!(ITM_STIMULUS_PORT0 & 1));

	//Write to ITM stimulus port0
	ITM_STIMULUS_PORT0 = ch;
}//
i dont know whats inside it yet but somehow it somehow helps us printing on screen using swv
it only works on arm cortex m3/m4/m7









So i learned a lot of things in this one but not gonna explain the whole code here
I learned that we can do so many things using using the logic in c
Lets see we made the keypad usefull using code otherwise it was nothing just bunch of buttons on a pad
It was intence but enjoyable
