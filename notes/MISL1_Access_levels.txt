So there are two modes of operations in ARM Cortex-M processors
1.Thread mode
2.Handler mode

Every code inside main() and most code runs in Thread mode
But ISRs(Interrupt service routines) runs in Handler mode

And in these modes there are two types of access levels-
1.Privilaged
2.Unprivilaged

Handler Mode always runs on Privilages access level
But in Thread mode you can chage the access levels from privilaged to unpriv
Using the control register



Summary--
-You can switch between privileged and unprivileged modes in software
- ISRs always run in Handler Mode (privileged)
- Inline assembly is used to access special registers
