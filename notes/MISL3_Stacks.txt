This code tells us how to switch from MSP(Main stack pointer) to PSP(Process stack pointer).
Why do we do that?
Sometimes we need to separate the main stack which os uses from the stack used by user preventing
user from corrupting the OS stack. 
In the code we used the attribute naked 
__attribute__((naked))
It helps in keeping the compiler from adding any prologue/epilogue code in inline assembly codes.
Its commonly used in RTOS.
